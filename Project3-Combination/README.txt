To run the program, openGL must be running with the dependencies freeglut.dll and glew32.dll included.

I used the youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p76pJsUP44

that the professor has provided to setup my system exactly the same including using Visual Studios 2015.

I included all the files, however if your compilation is similar to the professor's set-up on windows, then the source files

CubeMesh.h
main.cpp
QuadMesh.cpp
QuadMesh.h
VECTOR3D.h

are all the files that should be needed. 

The project can be run via openGLass3 solution file. 

For instructions on how my project works, the char 't' can be pressed to bring up the instructions in the terminal popup that is opened along with the glut frame.

The project begins in submarine mode where it can be moved around the terrain.

The user can press F2 to change to periscope mode.

F1 can also be pressed to change orientation of camera.
