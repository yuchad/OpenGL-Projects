To run the program, openGL must be running with the dependencies freeglut.dll and glew32.dll included.

I used the youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p76pJsUP44

that the professor has provided to setup my system exactly the same including using Visual Studios 2015.

I included all the files, however if your compilation is similar to the professor's set-up on windows, then the source files

CubeMesh.h
main.cpp
QuadMesh.cpp
QuadMesh.h
VECTOR3D.h

are all the files that should be needed. 

The project can be run via openGLass2 solution file. 

For instructions on how my project works, the char 't' can be pressed to bring up the instructions in the terminal popup that is opened along with the glut frame.

As for interactive blobs, the user must first be in blob mode. 
When the user left clicks on the mesh, a blob will be created. 
For blob width and height the user can use the arrow keys to adjust the dimensions, however will not work on the current blob, only the next blob created.
